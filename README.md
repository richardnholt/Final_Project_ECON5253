# Final_Project_ECON5253
Final Research Project for Data Science for Economists Course

The experiment was conducted by first finding the data for the models. The data can be found in a number of places and can be read in and manipulated using the "CODE.R" code located in the "Final Code and Data" folder. These data include:
- The national GDP data found at the St. Louis FRED website
- The state-by-state GDP data found at the St. Louis FRED website
- The national migration data found at the U.S. Census website
- The state-by-state migration data found at the U.S. Census website

All data associated with the "CODE.R" code can be found and viewed with the code itself in the "Final Code and Data" folder. The research contained in this repository is easily reproduced by simply running the "CODE.R" file. The file can be manipulated and adjusted to account for changes in the data, but manual changes would have to be made to the code itself. Without any adjustments, the code contained carefully outlines the process by which the data is cleaned and organized for use.

The code can be used and is ready to read in the data and create the models outlined in the document titled "Data_Science_Final_Paper.pdf" in the "Final Products" folder.

The figures that the code creates and that the final paper use in its analysis are located in the "Figures" folder.

A short presentation that summarizes the key points of the research project can be found in the "Final Projects" folder.

All sources that were referenced and cited are found with in the "Sources" folder with a bibliography called "bib.bib" in the "Sources" folder.
