"1/ The 2014 CPS ASEC included redesigned questions for income and health insurance coverage. All of the approximately 98,000 addresses were selected to receive the improved set of health insurance coverage items. The improved income questions were implemented using a split panel design.  Approximately 68,000 addresses were selected to receive a set of income questions similar to those used in the 2013 CPS ASEC. The remaining 30,000 addresses were selected to receive the redesigned income questions. The source of data for this table is the CPS ASEC sample of 98,000 addresses.",,,,,,,,,,,,

"4/ Caution should be used when comparing numbers/rates of movers within the same county and from a different county between the 1999-2000 to 2004-2005 period with other periods. A change in processing resulted in a shift in the distribution of movers for these years.

"8/ The 1-year geographic mobility question was not asked between 1972 through 1975 and 1977 to 1980. The first half of the decade (1971-1975) asked about migration since 1970 and the second half (1976-1980) since 1975. Therefore, only 1970-1971 and 1975-1976 ask a comparable 1-year question.
